### Description
A small toy project I did when I was a thrid-year student in 2020. 
This project implements Q-Learning, a reinforcement learning algorithm, to train a flappy bird bot agent. 
### Requirements
Make sure you are using `python 2.7.x` and [pyglet==1.2.4](http://www.pyglet.org).
To install pyglet, use
```
pip install pyglet==1.2.4
```
### Run
Directly run `bot.py`, and then you will see a Flappy Bird game window which shows a bird bot flying aimlessly. You can also modify the algorithm to train your own bird.

Enjoy~
